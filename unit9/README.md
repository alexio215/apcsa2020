# Unit 9: Inheritance

This unit introduces the concept of inheritance, the ability to have functionality extend from one class to another. The relationships this process creates are examined through the use of class hierarchy diagrams and examples where objects are declared and initialized as different types.
## Duration
* 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
* Inheritance
* Inheritance overriding methods
* Is-a and has-a relationships

## Lessons
* Unit 9: Lesson 1 – Inheritance – This lesson introduces inheritance by showing how a class can be extended to create a subclass (MOD).
* Unit 9: Lesson 2 - Inheritance Overriding Methods: This lesson describes in further detail how methods from a parent class can be overridden in the child class (MOD).
* Unit 9: Lesson 3 - Is-a and Has-a Relationships: This lesson describes in further detail the relationship between parent and child classes, including the effect of declaring objects of a child type as the parent type (MOD).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
* Students will create a new class (Skill 3.B).
* Students will write their code so it interacts with existing code by extending a class for which they are given the source code (Skill 1.C).
* Students will override a method according to specifications by calling a method from the superclass (Skill 3.C).
* Students will make decisions about how they would design a class hierarchy for a program (Skill 1.A).

## Assignment
* Assignment 9: Ultimate Frisbee: Students will create multiple classes, related by inheritance, to represent different types of people in a sporting scenario (Skill 3.B).

## Assessments and Labs
